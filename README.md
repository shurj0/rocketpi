# RocketPi

This program was coded for the MSU Rocketry team.

It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi. Executing the main.py script prompts the user to input text commands in order to activate various functions of the rocket. 

The Rocket class allows for the implementation of mechanisms easily. As such, while this program is still very much for testing purposes only, extending it to implement the final version can be done quite simply.
